👋 Hello There!

## I'm Vadym

With over 6 years of experience in automation testing for web-based software applications, I am a passionate speaker, writer, teacher, and open source contributor. 

My expertise spans developing E2E, UI, API, Unit, and Component automation tests using TypeScript, JavaScript, Cypress, WebdriverIO, Playwright, and Mocha. I have a proven track record of setting up test automation frameworks from scratch, managing testing environments, and implementing robust Continuous Integration pipelines.

As a Team Lead, I have mentored engineers, guided goal-setting, and supported team members in their professional growth and promotions. My focus on efficiency and quality has led to significant achievements, such as reducing testing time by 30% through automation and enhancing product quality by identifying critical bugs early in the development cycle.

My current tech stack includes TypeScript and JavaScript, with hands-on experience in Cypress, Playwright, and WebdriverIO. I am dedicated to sharing knowledge with the community through my blogs and talks, and I regularly contribute to open source projects.

When I’m not writing code or exploring new technologies, I enjoy sharing my expertise as a speaker and teacher, helping others grow in the field of test automation.
