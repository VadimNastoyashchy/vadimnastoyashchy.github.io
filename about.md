👋 Hello There!

## I'm Vadym

![Vadym avatar]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/avatar.png){: .about-avatar }

With over **6 years of experience in automation testing** for web-based software applications, I am a passionate speaker, writer, teacher, and open source contributor.

My expertise spans developing **E2E, UI, API, Unit, and Component** automation tests using **TypeScript, JavaScript, Cypress, WebdriverIO, Playwright, and Mocha**. I have a proven track record of setting up test automation frameworks from scratch, managing testing environments, and implementing robust **CI pipelines**.

As a **Team Lead**, I have mentored engineers, guided goal-setting, and supported team members in their professional growth and promotions. My focus on efficiency and quality has led to measurable results, including:
- 🚀 Reducing testing time by **30%**
- 🐞 Identifying critical bugs early in the development cycle
- ⚙️ Improving overall product stability through automation

My current tech stack includes **TypeScript and JavaScript**, with hands-on experience in **Cypress, Playwright, and WebdriverIO**. I am dedicated to sharing knowledge with the community through blog posts, conference talks, and open source contributions.
