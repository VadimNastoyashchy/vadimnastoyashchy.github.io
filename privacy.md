### 1. Data collection

I do not collect any personal data directly through my blog site. However, I use third-party services for analytics, email marketing, and database management. These services may collect data as outlined below:

#### 1.1. Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics to gather anonymized information about how visitors interact with my website. Google Analytics does not collect personal data, use cookies, or track users across the web. All analytics data is aggregated and non-identifiable.

#### 1.2. Github comments

I use giscus for the comments section. To be able to leave comments, you need to be logged in using Github. The personal data of users is stored and used only by Github

### 2. Data sharing

I do not sell, rent, or trade any personal information to third parties. I share your data only with the service providers mentioned above (Google Analytics, Github), and they process the data following their own privacy policies.

### 3. Your rights

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have certain rights regarding your data, including:

Right to Access: You can request a copy of your data held by my third-party services.

Right to Rectification: You can ask to update or correct your information if it is inaccurate.

Right to Erasure: You can request that I delete your data if it is no longer necessary for the purposes I collected it. I commit to removing your data from my systems, including giscus.app, within 30 days of your request.

Right to Restrict Processing: You can ask me to limit how I use your data.

Right to Data Portability: You can request that your data be transferred to another organization.
